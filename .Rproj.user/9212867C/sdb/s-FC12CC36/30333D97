You must use the \n#   database to answer the questions below and show the code for your entire \n#   analysis. Your analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. \n#   You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.\n\n#=============================Questions=========================================\n#Your data analysis must address the following questions:\n    \n# 1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE\n#    variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?\n\n# 2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic \n#    consequences?\n\n#Consider writing your report as if it were to be read by a government or \n#    municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather\n#    events and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events.\n#    However, there is no need to make any specific recommendations in your report.\n\n\n#============================Read in the Data===================================\n\n# Download the data\n\n    download.file(\"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2\", \"StormData.csv.bz2\")\n\n# Read the data into R\n\n    stormdata<-read.csv(\"StormData.csv.bz2\")\n\n#=========================Initial Exploratory Analysis==========================\n\n    summary(stormdata)\n    head(stormdata)\n    tail(stormdata)\n\n    hist(stormdata$FATALITIES)\n    hist(stormdata$FATALITIES[stormdata$FATALITIES!=0])\n    summary(stormdata$FATALITIES[stormdata$FATALITIES!=0])\n    table(stormdata$FATALITIES)\n    table(stormdata$INJURIES)\n    table(stormdata$PROPDMG)\n    hist(stormdata$PROPDMG)\n    hist(stormdata$PROPDMG[stormdata$PROPDMG>0])\n\n# Population Health variables: FATALITIES, INJURIES\n",
